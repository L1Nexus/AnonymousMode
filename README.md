# Caution

In order to make the enemy health-bar, name and icon invisible, this mod uses `HidePermanentCockpitRui()`.(This may cause some strange performances.)

If you want to get that off, just modify the `HidePermanentCockpitRui` from `true` to `false` in the mod.json.

# What this mod brings

This will make the other players’ names look like “Pilot0000” or “\*\*\*\*\*\*” in the scoreboard and the obituary.

You can configure the performance in the mod.json.

# Further updates

- Find a way to modify the enemy `CrosshairNames`.
- Have a better nickname spawner.
